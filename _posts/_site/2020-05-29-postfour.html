<p>I have a new blog and you’ve found it. Welcome! My first instinct was to start
posting here without acknowledging why I’ve opened up a new online front. But at this
point it feels irresponsible to dump more content into the digital slurry without
explaining oneself, and besides, describing what I’m doing is the best way I know
to trick myself into getting started–it feels like cheating but it works.</p>

<p>So, what is this? Last year, a friend recommended creating an alt account on Twitter
in order to break free of some of the restrictions that an online persona imposes.
Kind of like putting on a mask, which now we all have to do for completely different
reasons. As I can barely manage one internet identity, much less two, I didn’t make
an alt (as far as you know) but for a McLuhan disciple like myself, a new medium is
nearly as good as a new identity.</p>

<p>That’s a long-winded way of saying that I don’t know what this blog is going to be
about, and I don’t want to know until I start posting. I send a <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/">weekly newsletter</a>, as you probably know, and writing that is as delightful
as ever. But the newsletter is ~500 words a week and I want to keep it compact,
rather than cramming more and more material into that channel. Here, I’m not a guest
in your inbox and the tacit responsibility that accompanies that privilege doesn’t
exist. We’re at my place and I can do whatever I want.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the fate of my old Wordpress blog, which was active from
2012-2018, it’s still intact <a href="https://www.kneelingbus.net">here</a>. I plan to migrate
it over to this site eventually.</p>

<p>Anyway, stay tuned.</p>
