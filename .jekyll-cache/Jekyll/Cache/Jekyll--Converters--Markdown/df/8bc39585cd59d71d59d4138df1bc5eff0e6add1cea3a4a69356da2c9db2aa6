I"ÿ<p>I just discovered Chip Brownâ€™s recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/magazine/whit-stillman-and-the-wasps.html">New York Times profile of Whit Stillman</a>, which is phenomenal. I already loved Stillmanâ€™s films, but after reading the article he has become one of my heroes.</p>

<p>I restrained myself from tweeting every great line from the piece but Iâ€™ll list a few here that resonated with me most:</p>

<p><em>He says he has no assets but finds having no assets to be â€œpathologically exhilarating.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€¦his Harvard thesis, â€œTen Families,â€ on the lack of dynastic control in American family-run companies.</em></p>

<p><em>Whit Stillman resembles nothing so much as a character from a Whit Stillman film.</em></p>

<p><em>â€œWhat I like and find liberating in dialogue comedy is that the characters, and what they say, are not me.â€</em></p>

<p><em>Since returning to New York in 2010, he has lived like a hermit crab, scuttling from sublet to sublet. â€œIâ€™ve always wanted to live out of two suitcases,â€ he said.</em></p>

<p><em>As lunch was winding down, Stillman filled a cup with coffee from a Dunkinâ€™ Donuts Box Oâ€™ Joe. He spotted a dime on the floor. â€œMoney!â€ he said reaching for the coin.</em></p>

<p><em>Ten years after his graduation from Harvard, Stillman dispatched a note to the Class of â€™73 Tenth Anniversary Report. Where fellow classmates were crowing about their blessed lives, Stillman, then 31, had only a paltry item to contribute: â€œI am still building up momentum but will have more to report for the next edition.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œThis is ground zero of a new dance craze!â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œWe should probably chat before you write too much â€” everything I told you was a lie.â€</em></p>
