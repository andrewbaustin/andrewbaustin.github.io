I"É<p>Venkatesh Rao recently asked me to write <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/10/23/navigating-the-holey-plane/">a guest post</a> for his fantastic blog, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/">Ribbonfarm</a>. I was thrilled to have the opportunityâ€”Ribbonfarm is among my favorite blogs and one that I reference constantly in my Kneeling Bus posts.</p>

<p>Go on over there and take a look. Also, start following Ribbonfarm if you donâ€™t already.</p>
