I"Ÿ<p>One of the more interesting recent developments in the urban planning sphere has been Tony Hsieh‚Äôs multimillion-dollar investment in <a href="http://downtownproject.com/">revitalizing downtown Las Vegas</a>. Hsieh, the CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos, wants to redevelop the city‚Äôs core with his company‚Äôs offices as the anchor, creating a dense and vibrant environment where his creative class employees can live, work, and otherwise thrive. The plan reflects a corporate philosophy that applies Jane Jacobs‚Äô urbanist principles to office environments, an approach explained well <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_12_11_a_working.html">by Malcolm Gladwell</a>, but Hsieh‚Äôs scheme is unique in that it won‚Äôt be confined to the Zappos headquarters: Hsieh wants to remake downtown Las Vegas as a whole. In both cases, a more innovative workplace culture is the ultimate goal, but Hsieh seems interested in creating something with positive externalities.</p>

<p>Hsieh‚Äôs plan for Las Vegas is idealistic, ambitious, and <a href="http://observatory.designobserver.com/alexandralange/feature/city-of-shoes-is-urbanism-scalable/33118/">controversial</a>, but most of all it rests upon a great irony: Zappos has perfected a business model that undermines physical retail and thus helps to erode the vitality of many American downtowns. The clearest example of this is Amazon‚Äôs impact on bookstores. If you live in New York or San Francisco you might not understand how much a Borders could matter to a city‚Äôs downtown, but many smaller cities with fewer cultural assets depend more on whatever they‚Äôve got. In many cases, ‚Äúwhat they‚Äôve got‚Äù has been a chain bookstore like Borders (which can remain vacant for years after the tenant goes away‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen it happen). While Zappos has not affected shoe stores as drastically as Amazon has affected bookstores, the company has certainly captured plenty of revenue that shoppers previously spent in their own city‚Äôs commercial districts. The basic economic reality that Zappos represents and Hsieh‚Äôs high-profile, symbolic intervention in downtown Las Vegas are seemingly at odds: the latter putting a band-aid on a wound the former is currently making worse.</p>

<p>Bookstores and a few other niches aside, we haven‚Äôt really begun to see the full impact of online shopping on urban retail. E-commerce has become much more sophisticated in the last few years, with Amazon Prime offering a level of convenience that rivals a trip to the CVS on the corner, and it would not be surprising to see many other types of stores fall by the wayside as their online competition surpasses them in convenience. The logical conclusion of those developments is the (admittedly extreme) prediction made by Stephen Gordon: <a href="http://blog.speculist.com/scenarios/the-coffee-shop-take-over.html">In the future everything will be a coffee shop</a>. That is, the only spaces we‚Äôll need for working, shopping, and learning are comfortable places where we can get on the internet together.</p>

<p>If everything will eventually be a coffee shop, than Tony Hsieh‚Äôs business and his Las Vegas plan start to seem more consistent. They‚Äôre both manifestations of what I‚Äôm going to call the Meatspace City: the fully wired urban condition. Even when online shopping becomes entirely frictionless, a lot of shopping will still happen in <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> because¬† of its tactile nature. Shoe shopping, for example, generally requires trying the shoes on. Book shopping is much less tactile, which is why the internet absorbed it so easily. Shopping is slowly bifurcating into a component easily handled online (price comparison, item selection, payment) and a component best accomplished in a physical store (trying things on, picking them up). Increasingly, stores will be showrooms where we decide what we want and then order it online (see: <a href="http://www.bonobos.com/welcome/n">Bonobos</a>). Urban commerce will be increasingly based upon the purely physical: food, drink, showrooms, and coffee shops. Brooklyn feels like it‚Äôs getting there. Everything the internet can‚Äôt do better, and only those things. The Meatspace City.</p>
