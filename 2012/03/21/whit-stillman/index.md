I just discovered Chip Brown's recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/magazine/whit-stillman-and-the-wasps.html">New York Times profile of Whit Stillman</a>, which is phenomenal. I already loved Stillman's films, but after reading the article he has become one of my heroes.

I restrained myself from tweeting every great line from the piece but I'll list a few here that resonated with me most:

<em>He says he has no assets but finds having no assets to be “pathologically exhilarating.”</em>

<em>...his Harvard thesis, “Ten Families,” on the lack of dynastic control in American family-run companies.</em>

<em>Whit Stillman resembles nothing so much as a character from a Whit Stillman film.</em>

<em>“What I like and find liberating in dialogue comedy is that the characters, and what they say, are not me.”</em>

<em>Since returning to New York in 2010, he has lived like a hermit crab, scuttling from sublet to sublet. “I’ve always wanted to live out of two suitcases,” he said.</em>

<em>As lunch was winding down, Stillman filled a cup with coffee from a Dunkin’ Donuts Box O’ Joe. He spotted a dime on the floor. “Money!” he said reaching for the coin.</em>

<em>Ten years after his graduation from Harvard, Stillman dispatched a note to the Class of ’73 Tenth Anniversary Report. Where fellow classmates were crowing about their blessed lives, Stillman, then 31, had only a paltry item to contribute: “I am still building up momentum but will have more to report for the next edition.”</em>

<em>“This is ground zero of a new dance craze!”</em>

<em>"We should probably chat before you write too much — everything I told you was a lie.”</em>
