<p>I already mentioned that I'm <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/blogging-residencies/">doing this</a> all year for the great blog <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/">Ribbonfarm</a>, and now I'm on the board with my <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/02/05/machine-cities-and-ghost-cities/">first post</a>.
