    <h4>The Kid Is Back</h4>
    <p>August 29, 2012</p>
  </header>
  <div><p>Kneeling Bus took the past month off for reasons including travel, moving apartments, and the dog days effect. Better to wave the white flag at August than put up a fight. But now Labor Day is looming large and Kneeling Bus is going back to school–which is to say, we are now redoubling our efforts (and by “we” I mean “I”). The kid is back!</p>
